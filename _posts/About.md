Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
import random

# ask user to start game

print("hello, this is the 8 ball. ask a question and press enteinput()

# choose responses

a = random.randint(0, 5)

if a == 0:
  print("not looking good")
  
elif a == 1:
  print("looks good")
  
elif a == 2:
  print("try again")
  
elif a == 3:
  print("seems legit")
  
elif a == 4:
  print("DONT DO IT")
  
elif a ==5:
  print("seems odd")
```
